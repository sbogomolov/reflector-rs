//! Single-threaded reactor: a registration arena dispatched against I/O readiness.
//!
//! Registrations are addressed by a `Copy` [`Key`] into a generational-index
//! [`arena`], never a pointer — which lets a handler reach back into the reactor
//! (register/unregister others, arm write interest) without aliasing the storage
//! it lives in. A freed slot bumps its generation, so a stale key fails safe
//! (resolves to nothing) instead of dangling.
//!
//! A [`Handler`] is registered once and **owns** the fds it [`watch`](Reactor::watch)es;
//! each fd is watched under its own [`RegKey`], so an event names the exact fd and
//! dispatches the owning handler. Unwatching (or unregistering) removes the kernel
//! interest *first*, then the handler drops and closes the fds — interest is always
//! gone before a fd closes: no stale-interest window, and no fd the reactor
//! double-owns (a capture socket the handler also needs for I/O stays the handler's).
//!
//! Dispatch **takes the handler out of its slot** for its call, so `&mut Reactor` is
//! free to hand to it — it can watch/unwatch fds and register/unregister others, which
//! a loop holding an iterator into the storage would risk invalidating mid-iteration;
//! nothing borrows the arenas during the call.
